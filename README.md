__Network Structures and Partisan Dynamics: Examining the Effect of Different Neighborhood Networks on Partisan Homogeneity across the Urban-Rural Divide__

__Abstract:__

In recent years, polarization in opinions and political preferences has intensified in many
societies, driven by complex interactions between interpersonal social influence processes,
specific meso-level conditions like network structures, and macro-level outcomes such as partisan
polarization. This research examines how meso-level conditions, particularly network
structures, influence partisan homogeneity across the urban-rural divide. Using a Bounded
Confidence Model, I simulate partisan affiliation convergence and polarization in both urban
and rural settings, initializing the simulation with US voter registration data to address
criticisms of Agent Based Models for lacking empirical validation. The findings suggest that
rural neighborhoods experience a greater increase in partisan homogeneity than urban areas,
primarily due to the influence of network structures rather than a narrower socialization
process.
